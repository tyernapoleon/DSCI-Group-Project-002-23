    "What affects the students' academic performance? That's a very popular question in many countries, no matter parents, teachers or students themselves are very concerned about these factors, especially for the student performance during primary and secondary education stage. Educators or statisticians also did some research and put forward some arguements already. Next, our group will analyze a dataset from Portuguese secondary school to get more senses about these questions.\n",

    "**【Background Information】**<br>\n",
    "This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. <br>\n",
    "The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school-related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. <br>Two datasets are provided regarding the performance on two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> **Important Notes**: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).\n"
